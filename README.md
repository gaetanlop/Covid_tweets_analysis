In this project, I wanted to explore how people feel regarding the pandemic. Therefore, I decided to analyze tweets about Covid.
* Text preprocessing: removed https link, removed punctuations, lowered the text, removed stopwords.
* Performed a sentiment analysis of the different tweets.
* Looked at the most common words (N_grams).
* Checked the most popular hashtags.
* Used sentiment polarity in order to find out how people feel regarding the pandemic.
* **Tools used**: pandas, numpy, nltk, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
